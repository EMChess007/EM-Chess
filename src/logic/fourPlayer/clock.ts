/**
 * 4 Player Chess — the per-seat clocks, as a pure model (the React hook that drives it from a timer is useFourPlayerClock.ts).
 *
 * FOUR INDEPENDENT CLOCKS, and only the seat whose turn it is runs. That seat is always an ACTIVE one: the engine hands out the turn
 * only to active seats (eliminated seats are resolved instantly inside `advance`), so a dead king's random walk costs nobody time and
 * an eliminated seat's clock is simply never touched again — it stays frozen at whatever it showed when the seat went out. A seat that
 * runs out of time is eliminated through the engine's normal path, `resign(state, seat, rng, 'timeout')`: no points for anyone, its
 * pieces go dead and its king starts walking, the turn passes on, and the game ends if that was the third elimination.
 *
 * With "No time limit" the clock is disabled (`enabled: false`): nothing ticks and nobody can time out.
