/**
 * 4 Player Chess — turn passing, elimination and scoring (FFA). This is the part of the rules that has no 2-player analogue.
 *
 * THE KEY IDEA: CHECKMATE IS NEVER "PENDING" STATE — IT IS DETECTED LAZILY, WHEN THE MATED SEAT'S TURN ARRIVES.
 * After every applied move the turn passes clockwise to the next non-frozen seat (`advance`), and only THEN is that seat looked at:
 *   - ACTIVE seat with a legal move → it is simply its turn. (It may be in check; it must answer it.)
 *   - ACTIVE seat with NO legal move → in check = CHECKMATED, otherwise STALEMATED. It is eliminated on the spot, the elimination
 *     consumes its turn (it does not also move), and the loop carries on to the next seat.
 *   - DEAD-KING seat (eliminated earlier, king still walking) → the engine plays a random legal king move for it (empty squares only);
 *     with no legal move it FREEZES (checkmated or stalemated: no points either way) and is skipped from then on.
 *   - FROZEN seat → skipped.
 * Because nothing is decided until the mated seat's turn, every seat between the mating move and that turn gets to change the position:
 * a mate can dissolve (the checking piece is captured or blocked), or an intervening player can deliver the mate themselves — in that
 * case the credit goes to the seat that attacks the king and moved MOST RECENTLY before the mated seat's turn (`mateCredit`), not
 * necessarily to whoever first created the threat. Eliminating a seat also turns ITS pieces dead, which can lift checks on others,
 * which is why seats are evaluated one at a time, in order, rather than all at once.
 *
 * GAME END (FFA): as soon as at most ONE seat is still active (three eliminated), or when no checkmate is possible any more (every
 * active seat is a bare king — `isDeadPosition`), or the ply cap is reached. The winner(s) are the seat(s) with the HIGHEST SCORE
 * among all four (not only the survivor), ties shared.
 *
 * SCORING (simplified from chess.com's table; the numbers live in FourPlayerRules): capturing a live piece scores its value (pawn 1,
 * knight 3, bishop 5, rook 5, queen 9; a promoted piece is worth what it became, except the promoted queen: 1); dead pieces score 0; checkmating a seat +20 to the credited seat;
 * stalemating a seat gives the STALEMATED seat +20 and every other still-active seat +10. Not modelled: check-fork bonuses, draw
 * claims, points for mating an already-dead king.
