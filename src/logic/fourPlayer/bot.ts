/**
 * 4 Player Chess — the bot. Stockfish cannot play this game (no 4-seat position, no UCI variant), so this is a small heuristic in the
 * same spirit as the other variants' bots in bots.ts (chooseGiveawayBotMove, chooseAtomicBotMove, chooseHordeBotMove, …), and strength
 * is driven by an ELO number in the same way: the named roster bot a player picks (Kiddo 400 … The Unbeatable 3000) is passed in as
 * `elo` and decides how good its play is. It is a heuristic dial, not a calibrated rating — 4-player games are never rated.
 *
 * STRENGTH FROM ELO (`botStrength`) has three layers, all continuous or monotonic in the ELO:
 *  1. bestChance = 0.2 + 0.7 * clamp((elo - 400) / 2600): the chance of playing the bot's SCORED choice at all; otherwise it plays a
 *     uniformly random legal move (the exact family used by the other variants' bots: ~20% at 400, ~90% at 3000).
 *  2. noise = 2.5 * (1 - strength): random wobble added to every candidate's score, so a weak bot's "best" move is a plausible but
 *     often second-rate one rather than the true best (0 at 3000).
 *  3. a search TIER that decides what the scored choice can see:
 *       greedy  (elo < 1000): one ply — points won and material change only (it will hang pieces and walk into mates);
 *       careful (1000 <= elo < 1800): one ply plus a hanging-piece penalty, a castling nudge, and it spots mating/stalemating the
 *               next seat;
 *       deep    (elo >= 1800): two ply — assumes the next ACTIVE seat's worst reply for it, including being checkmated by it.
 *     (The other two seats move in between in ways nobody can predict, so they are covered only by the hanging-piece term.)
 *
 * Material is measured over ACTIVE seats only: an eliminated seat's pieces are dead, worth nothing to anyone, and a bot gets no credit
 * for "ganging up" on a corpse.
