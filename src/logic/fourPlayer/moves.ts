/**
 * 4 Player Chess — attack detection, move generation and applying a move to the board. See state.ts for the encoding and
 * elimination.ts for what happens AFTER a move (turn passing, checkmate/stalemate, scoring).
 *
 * MOVEMENT is exactly standard chess on the 160-square board: sliders' rays end at the cut corners, pawns move/capture in their
 * own seat's forward direction (any of the four axes), a pawn double-steps from its starting line and promotes (to a queen, always)
 * on its seat's promotion line.
 *
 * WHO ATTACKS WHOM. Every seat is the enemy of every other seat, but only ACTIVE seats attack: a dead (eliminated) seat's pieces
 * never give check and never capture; they only block lines. Kings are never captured — a king that is attacked is simply in check.
 *
 * LEGALITY generalises standard chess: a move is legal iff, after it, the mover's king is attacked by NO live enemy seat (so a
 * player in check from two opponents at once must answer both). A DEAD king (an eliminated seat's king, which keeps walking) obeys
 * the same rule but may only move to EMPTY squares and never castles.
 *
 * EN PASSANT is generic: a double step records the square it skipped; on the very next applied move any enemy pawn — of ANY seat,
 * i.e. in any direction — that can capture onto that square may do so (e.g. a Blue pawn can take a Red pawn en passant).
