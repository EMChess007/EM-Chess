/**
 * 4 Player Chess — game state, piece encoding, the start position and (de)serialisation. See board.ts for the geometry.
 *
 * STATE IS IMMUTABLE. Every function that "changes" a game returns a new FourPlayerState (the 196-byte cell array is copied per
 * ply — trivial next to the work of generating moves), which makes Undo a plain stack of states and keeps React happy.
 *
 * PIECES are single bytes: `seat * 16 + type`, 0 = empty, -1 = the cut corners. Types 1-6 are the ordinary pieces. Types 7-10 are
 * PROMOTED pieces (a pawn that reached its last line and became a queen / knight / bishop / rook): each MOVES like the ordinary piece
 * (`baseTypeOf`) but keeps its own code, because what it is worth when captured is decided by what it was promoted to (see
 * CAPTURE_POINTS) and because the UI marks promoted pieces.
 *
 * SEAT STATUS is the heart of the elimination rules (see elimination.ts):
 *   'active'    — a normal player.
 *   'dead-king' — eliminated (checkmated / stalemated / resigned / timed out). Every piece the seat owns is now DEAD: it blocks
 *                 squares and can be captured (for 0 points) but never moves, captures or gives check — EXCEPT the king, which keeps
 *                 walking (a random legal move to an empty square each time its turn comes round).
 *   'frozen'    — the walking king has itself been checkmated or has no move; the whole seat is inert and skipped.
 * A piece is dead exactly when its owner's status is not 'active': there is no per-piece "dead" flag to keep in sync.
