/**
 * 4 Player Chess — board geometry. Pure TypeScript: no React, no React Native, no chess.js (so the whole `fourPlayer/` folder can
 * be mirrored verbatim into the backend when Online arrives, the way the 2-player variants' rules blocks are).
 *
 * THE BOARD. 14 x 14 with a 3 x 3 corner cut out of each corner = 160 playable squares. It is stored as a flat 196-cell "mailbox"
 * (index = rank * 14 + file, both 0-based: file 0 = "a" … 13 = "n", rank 0 = "1" … 13 = "14"); the 36 corner cells exist in the
 * array but are marked off-board (`VALID[i] === 0`, and -1 in the cell array). Everything that walks the board uses the tables
 * below, which are built once at import time and already stop at the cut corners, so move generation never does a bounds check:
 * a slider's ray simply ends where the board does.
 *
 * SEATS. Four seats in CLOCKWISE turn order, matching their position on the screen: Red (bottom) → Blue (left) → Yellow (top) →
 * Green (right). A pawn's "forward" is the direction towards the opposite edge: Red +rank, Blue +file, Yellow -rank, Green -file.
 *
 * A seat is NOT a chess colour. Nothing here (or anywhere in `fourPlayer/`) assumes two sides: "enemy" always means "any other seat".
