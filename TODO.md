# EM-Chess — known issues / TODO

Tracked items that are real but deliberately NOT part of whatever change found them. Each entry says
what is wrong, how it was verified, and where to start fixing. Remove an entry when it is fixed.

## Giveaway bot picker still says "Stockfish 11"

**What's wrong.** `BotSelectScreen` prints `getEngineName(getEngineIdForElo(bot.elo))` on every bot card, so in
Giveaway each bot is labelled e.g. "Stockfish 11 (Classical)" even though Giveaway bots are the custom
`chooseGiveawayBotMove` heuristic (see `BotGameScreen`), not Stockfish. The label is now misleading, especially next
to Atomic's honest "Atomic search bot" label on the same screen. The "My Engines" (custom engine) cards also appear
for Giveaway and Atomic although those variants never use a UCI engine.

**Not fixed in the Atomic branch.** Separate fix on its own branch: show a Giveaway-specific label the way Atomic
does (one conditional in `BotSelectScreen`) and decide whether custom-engine cards should be hidden for variants
that can't use them.

## Threefold repetition never ends a game (any mode except Atomic)

**What's wrong.** Draw by threefold repetition is never detected anywhere in the app. Every game
screen builds its `ChessEngine` from the current FEN (`useMemo(() => new ChessEngine(fen, …), [fen, …])`
in `LocalGameScreen`, `BotGameScreen`, `ChessBoard`, `EngineVsEngineGameScreen`, …). chess.js only
counts repetitions from the moves it was actually *played through*, so a freshly-loaded engine has
no history and `isThreefoldRepetition()` / `isDraw()` can never fire. The 50-move rule (read from the
FEN's halfmove clock), stalemate and insufficient material still work, since they are functions of the
position alone.

The comment in `src/logic/gameOutcomeText.ts` (`case 'draw'`) claims `isDraw()` covers repetition — true
of chess.js in principle, false as the app uses it.

**How it was verified.** Playing 1.Nf3 Nf6 2.Ng1 Ng8 3.Nf3 Nf6 4.Ng1 Ng8 on one live `Chess` instance
gives `isThreefoldRepetition() === true`; a new `Chess(live.fen())` gives `false` (probe run during the
Atomic work; the same position, same code path every screen uses).

**Not fixed in the Atomic branch.** Atomic implements its own history-based repetition
(`isAtomicThreefoldRepetition` in `src/logic/atomic.ts`, fed `[initialFen, ...history.map(h => h.fenAfter)]`,
so it is correct after Undo). The other modes keep the old behaviour so nothing existing changes
unannounced.

**Suggested fix.** Generalise that helper to ordinary chess: key each position by FEN fields 1–4
(placement, side to move, castling, en passant — en passant only when a capture is actually legal, as
`atomicPositionKey` does) and treat the third occurrence of the latest position as a draw with reason
`'draw'`, computed in the screens from `history` the way `threeCheck`'s winner is. Needs: tests next to
`gameModes.test.ts`, a check of what the backend's `RoomChessEngine` does for Online games (not
verified whether the server tracks repetition itself), and a decision on whether Fog of War / Giveaway /
King of the Hill / Three-Check also want it (Fog of War and Giveaway probably not).
